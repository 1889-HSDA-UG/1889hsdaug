        <h2>About 1889 HSDA UGANDA</h2>
      <p>1889 HSDA Uganda stands on a proud heritage that traces back to the foundational principles of 1872. In 1889, these enduring truths were revised and 3 fundamental principles added, marking a pivotal moment in our history. Our identity emerged in response to a critical divergence in doctrine when the GCSDA church, in its departure from original teachings, introduced a multi-faceted concept of the divine i.e the Trinity in 1980.</p>
      
      <p>This shift‚Äîmoving away from the clear understanding of the One True God the Father and His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ‚Äîspurred a search for authenticity and a return to the time-honored landmarks of faith.</p>
  
      <p>Our mission is to proclaim the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ, to uplift Jesus as the only hope of salvation, and to prepare a people to meet Him at His soon return. We are committed to the restoration of the original Adventist message, to the proclamation of the Three Angels‚Äô Messages of Revelation 14, and to the preparation of a people who will stand faithful to the end.</p>
  
      <p>It therefore follows that our mission is both bold and uncompromising: to repair the spiritual breach caused by apostasy and to restore the pure, original message handed down through generations. We are committed to reviving the original principles that have sustained believers through the ages, ensuring that the timeless truths of our forebears continue to illuminate the path for today's faithful.</p>
  
      <p>At 1889 HSDA Uganda, we are not bound by nostalgia but are forward-thinking in our approach. We engage with the modern world while holding fast to the unchanging core of our beliefs. Our work is a call to both renewal and accountability‚Äîa journey back to a genuine relationship with the One True God. We invite you to join us in rediscovering and upholding the true landmarks of our faith, as we collectively move towards a future rooted in the clarity and power of original truth.</p>

            <h3>Support Our Mission</h3>
            <p>When God delivered Israel from Egypt to be a special treasure unto Himself, He taught them to devote a tithe of their possessions to the service of the tabernacle. This was a special offering, for a special work. All that remained of their property was God's, and was to be used to His glory. But the tithe was set apart for the support of those who ministered in the sanctuary. It was to be given from the first fruits of all the increase, and, with gifts and offerings, it provided ample means for supporting the ministry of the gospel for that time.  {CS 71.2}</p>
            <p><u>God requires no less of us than He required of His people anciently. His gifts to us are not less, but greater, than they were to Israel of old. <b>His service requires, and ever will require, means.</b> The great missionary work for the salvation of souls is to be carried forward. In the tithe, with gifts and offerings, God has made ample provision for this work. He intends that the ministry of the gospel shall be fully sustained. He claims the tithe as His own, and it should ever be regarded as a sacred reserve, to be placed in His treasury for the benefit of His cause, for the advancement of His work, for sending His messengers into "regions beyond," even to the uttermost parts of the earth.{CS 71.3}</u></p>
