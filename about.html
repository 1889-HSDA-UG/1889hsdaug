        <h2>About 1889 HSDA UGANDA</h2>
      <p>1889 HSDA Uganda stands on a proud heritage that traces back to the foundational principles of 1872. In 1889, these enduring truths were revised and 3 fundamental principles added, marking a pivotal moment in our history. Our identity emerged in response to a critical divergence in doctrine when the GCSDA church, in its departure from original teachings, introduced a multi-faceted concept of the divine i.e the Trinity in 1980.</p>
      
      <p>This shift‚Äîmoving away from the clear understanding of the One True God the Father and His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ‚Äîspurred a search for authenticity and a return to the time-honored landmarks of faith.</p>
  
      <p>Our mission is to proclaim the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ, to uplift Jesus as the only hope of salvation, and to prepare a people to meet Him at His soon return. We are committed to the restoration of the original Adventist message, to the proclamation of the Three Angels‚Äô Messages of Revelation 14, and to the preparation of a people who will stand faithful to the end.</p>
  
      <p>It therefore follows that our mission is both bold and uncompromising: to repair the spiritual breach caused by apostasy and to restore the pure, original message handed down through generations. We are committed to reviving the original principles that have sustained believers through the ages, ensuring that the timeless truths of our forebears continue to illuminate the path for today's faithful.</p>
  
      <p>At 1889 HSDA Uganda, we are not bound by nostalgia but are forward-thinking in our approach. We engage with the modern world while holding fast to the unchanging core of our beliefs. Our work is a call to both renewal and accountability‚Äîa journey back to a genuine relationship with the One True God. We invite you to join us in rediscovering and upholding the true landmarks of our faith, as we collectively move towards a future rooted in the clarity and power of original truth.</p>

        <h4>2. Institutional Background and Overview</h4>
        <div class="preview-content">
        <p>1889 HSDA UGANDA is an organized church body of Seventh day Adventists believers whose faith is 
            grounded on the original founding biblical fundamental principles of its pioneers. 
            We are part of the world-wide organized body of 1889 HSDA believers. Visit us at:

        <p><b>1889 HSDA UGANDA Primary, Technical and Missionary Hub</b> is therefore, a church institution formed by its organized members residing in Otuke District. These humble brains recognizing the mission of the church, the duty that rests upon members and the diversity of talents in service, strategically blended these astute ideas to help the church body stand true to its mission and serving humanity. By God‚Äôs grace, each involved member plays a critical role as God prospers in bringing this strategic vision to fruition.</p>
        <p>The idea was birthed when members experienced difficulty in accessing and providing Christian education principles to their children and also thought for the best approach to reach out the communities around with the message of salvation. After several productive consultative meetings amongst the available members with country residence in the area, it became inevitable to explore Christ‚Äôs method strategy that enriches the church and the communities around. We are humbled and turn to God for guidance and leading as promised in His holy word; <i>‚ÄúCommit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.‚Äù <b>Psalms 37:5.</b></i></p>
        <p><b>The Primary Section</b> of the hub aims at providing affordable Christian based education while guided by the National Primary School Curriculum for Uganda to a wide range of pupils from diverse backgrounds, focusing on academic achievement, character development, and preparation for further studies or vocational pathways.</p>
        <p><b>The Technical Section</b> aims at equipping interested members of the community and the church with affordable, recognizable and relevant skills for service and a living.</p>
        <p><b>The Missionary Section</b> will aim at lifting the Christian banner in medical missionary training and practice through establishment of a Sanitarium. This section will provide formal and informal evangelistic training, lead church activities and chaplainship within and without the institution.</p>
        <p><b>1889 HSDA Uganda Primary, Tertiary and Missionary hub</b> is located in Ataparolam village, Gotojwang parish, Olilim Sub County, Otuke District, Uganda.</p>
